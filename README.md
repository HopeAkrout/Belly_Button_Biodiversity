# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

The client requested the creation of this .html page so that volunteers would be able to look up their own subject ID number to view the belly button culture results.  The data is broken up into four different charts so that one can view the person's demographic, how often they wash their navels, a complete list of bacteria found in the culture taken and the top ten bacteria found.
